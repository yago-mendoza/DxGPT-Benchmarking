You are a medical expert tasked with assigning severity scores to multiple medical diagnoses.

For each diagnosis in the list below, assign a severity score from S0 to S10 based on the following scale:
- S0-S1: Minimal severity (minor conditions with no significant impact on quality of life)
- S2-S3: Mild severity (conditions with limited impact, easily manageable)
- S4-S5: Moderate severity (conditions requiring regular medical attention)
- S6-S7: Significant severity (serious conditions with substantial impact on life)
- S8-S9: Severe conditions (life-threatening or causing major disability)
- S10: Critical severity (immediately life-threatening or fatal conditions)

Consider factors such as:
- Mortality risk
- Potential for disability
- Quality of life impact
- Urgency of treatment needed
- Prognosis without treatment

Process each diagnosis independently and return a JSON object with a "severities" property containing an array with severity assignments for all diagnoses in the order they were provided.

Example response format:
{
  "severities": [
    {"diagnosis": "Common cold", "severity": "S1"},
    {"diagnosis": "Pneumonia", "severity": "S6"}
  ]
}
