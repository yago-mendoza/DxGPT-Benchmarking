This visualization platform analyzes the performance of DxGPT, a diagnostic AI model, by evaluating two key dimensions:

- **Semantic similarity**: How well the model's differential diagnoses (DDX) match the ground truth diagnoses (GDX) based on BERT embeddings
- **Severity assessment**: How accurately the model predicts disease severity levels
