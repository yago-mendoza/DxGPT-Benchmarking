# DxGPT Diagnostic Benchmarking Analysis - README

## Overview

This visualization platform analyzes the performance of DxGPT, a diagnostic AI model, by evaluating two key dimensions:
- **Semantic similarity**: How well the model's differential diagnoses (DDX) match the ground truth diagnoses (GDX) based on BERT embeddings
- **Severity assessment**: How accurately the model predicts disease severity levels

## Data Structure

### Input Files

The analysis requires two JSON files:

1. **Semantic Evaluation** (`*semantic_evaluation*.json`): Contains BERT-based similarity scores [0,1] between ground truth diagnoses (GDX) and differential diagnoses (DDX)
2. **Severity Evaluation** (`*severity_evaluation*.json`): Contains severity assessments (S0-S10 scale) assigned by an LLM for both GDX and DDX

### Key Concepts

- **Case**: Each evaluation unit, typically associated with one primary GDX
- **GDX**: Ground truth diagnosis (1 per case)
- **DDX**: Differential diagnoses (5 per case)
- **Semantic Score**: Maximum similarity score across all GDX-DDX combinations for a case
- **Severity Score**: Normalized average distance between GDX and DDX severities

## Severity Score Calculation

The severity score measures how far the model's severity predictions deviate from the ground truth:

1. For each DDX, calculate the absolute distance from its GDX: `|S_DDX - S_GDX|`
2. Normalize by the maximum possible distance:
   - If S_GDX ≤ 5: max distance = 10 - S_GDX
   - If S_GDX > 5: max distance = S_GDX
3. Average these normalized distances across all 5 DDX
4. Result: severity score ∈ [0,1] where 0 = perfect match

## Visualizations

### 1. Statistical Summary
Overview of key metrics including mean scores, standard deviations, and ranges for both semantic and severity evaluations.

### 2. Combined Bias Evaluation Plot

This scatter plot reveals the model's diagnostic tendencies:
- **Y-axis**: Semantic similarity score [0,1]
- **X-axis**: Severity score (distance), positioned left (negative) or right (positive) based on bias
- **Positioning logic**:
  - Calculate aggregate distances for DDX below GDX (optimistic) and above GDX (pessimistic)
  - If optimistic distances > pessimistic distances → place left (blue)
  - If pessimistic distances > optimistic distances → place right (red)
  - Equal distances → center (gray)
- **Bottom histogram**: Distribution of severity scores across all cases
- **Mean markers**: Show average positions for each group and overall

**Interpretation**: Left-side clustering indicates the model tends to underestimate severity (optimistic bias), while right-side clustering indicates overestimation (pessimistic bias).

### 3. Semantic Analysis Plots

#### Semantic Score Distribution
Simple histogram with KDE overlay showing the distribution of semantic similarity scores across all cases. Higher scores indicate better diagnostic accuracy.

#### Ridge Plot
Overlapping density distributions of semantic scores, stratified by GDX severity level (S3-S10). This reveals whether diagnostic accuracy varies with disease severity. Each ridge represents the distribution of best-match semantic scores for cases with that GDX severity.

### 4. Severity Analysis Plots

#### GDX vs DDX Severity Comparison
Scatter plot with boxplots showing the relationship between ground truth and predicted severities:
- **X-axis**: GDX severity (S0-S10)
- **Y-axis**: Mean severity of the 5 DDX
- **Diagonal line**: Perfect prediction (y=x)
- **Blue points/boxplots**: Cases where DDX severities < GDX (optimistic)
- **Red points/boxplots**: Cases where DDX severities > GDX (pessimistic)
- **Bottom histogram**: Distribution of GDX severities

**Interpretation**: Points below the diagonal indicate underestimation of severity; points above indicate overestimation.

#### Severity Levels Distribution
Comparative histogram showing the frequency of each severity level (S3-S10):
- **Green bars**: GDX counts (×5 for visual scaling to match DDX volume)
- **Orange bars**: DDX counts
- **KDE curves**: Smooth distribution overlays

This visualization reveals whether the model's severity predictions follow the same distribution as the ground truth.

#### Optimist vs Pessimist Evaluator Balance
Doughnut chart showing the distribution of optimistic vs pessimistic cases:
- **Blue segments**: Optimistic cases (DDX severities tend to be lower than GDX)
- **Red segments**: Pessimistic cases (DDX severities tend to be higher than GDX)
- **Gradient shading**: Darker shades represent higher values of n (1-5), where n indicates how many of the 5 DDX fall into that category
- **Center text**: Total counts for each bias type

**Interpretation**: A balanced model would show roughly equal blue and red areas. Dominance of blue indicates systematic underestimation of severity, while red dominance indicates overestimation.

## Cross-Plot Relationships

The visualizations work together to provide a comprehensive view:

1. **Semantic vs Severity Performance**: The Combined Bias plot shows whether good semantic matches (high Y values) correlate with accurate severity predictions (low X values)

2. **Severity Distribution Patterns**: Compare the Severity Levels Distribution with the GDX vs DDX Comparison to understand not just whether the model is biased, but how that bias manifests across different severity levels

3. **Diagnostic Confidence**: The Ridge Plot reveals whether the model's semantic accuracy varies with disease severity, which can be cross-referenced with the severity prediction patterns

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Mean Semantic Score**: Higher is better (closer to 1.0)
- **Mean Severity Score**: Lower is better (closer to 0.0)
- **Optimist/Pessimist Balance**: Closer to 50/50 indicates unbiased severity assessment
- **Score Correlation**: Ideal models show high semantic scores with low severity scores

This analysis framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diagnostic AI performance, revealing both accuracy and systematic biases that may require model adjustment.
