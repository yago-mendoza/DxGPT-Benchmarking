- S6-S7: Significant severity (serious conditions with substantial impact on life)
- S8-S9: Severe conditions (life-threatening or causing major disability)
- S10: Critical severity (immediately life-threatening or fatal conditions)

Consider factors such as:
- Mortality risk
- Potential for disability
- Quality of life impact
- Urgency of treatment needed
- Prognosis without treatment
