You are a strict medical evaluator.

INPUT
------
• Golden diagnosis: "{{ground_truth}}"      # value comes from the dataset
• Candidate list (index 1-5): {{output}}    # raw JSON array produced by the model

RULES
------
1. Look for synonyms – exact or clinically broader terms are allowed.
2. If several candidates match, choose the one with the **lowest index**.
3. Output JSON EXACTLY in this schema (no extra keys):

{
  "result": <0-5>,         // 0 : no synonym found
  "reason": "exact | broad | none"
}

The integer is (index + 0) when match found.
Be concise in "reason".
