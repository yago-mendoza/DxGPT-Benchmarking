+ Added diagnosis severity assessment pipeline using GPT-4o batch processing:
  - run1.py: Extracts unique diagnoses from both datasets, evaluates severity/rarity (S0-S10 scale) using LLM batching (N=100)
  - run2.py: Transforms CSV files to JSON format with nested diagnosis-severity mappings and diagnostic codes
  - Generated diagnosis_severity_mapping.csv with comprehensive severity assessment for all unique medical conditions
  - Created ramedis.json and urg_torre.json with structured diagnosis data including severity scores and diagnostic code nesting
