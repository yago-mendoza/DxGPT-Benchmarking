ETL Script for formatting diagnosis names in ramedis_bench dataset.

This script processes the 'diagnosis' column to extract and format multiple disease names:
- Splits diagnoses by " also known as ", " or ", and " due to "
- Creates a semicolon-separated list of unique disease names
- Makes the diagnosis column more concise and readable

Input: before.csv
Output: after.csv
