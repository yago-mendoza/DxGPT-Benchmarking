+ Implemented complete data transformation pipeline in run.py
+ Added find_longest_diagnostic_code() function to select optimal diagnostic code from all *_code columns
+ Added transform_dataset() function with column mapping:
  - id → id (direct)
  - case → case (direct)
  - diagnosis → golden-diagnosis
  - icd10_diagnosis → icd10_diagnosis_name
  - category → icd10_category_name
  - block → icd10_disease_group_name
  - sub_block → icd10_disease_name
  - diagnostic_code → longest value from all *_code columns
  - death, critical, pediatric, severity → direct mapping
+ Added main() function with error handling and file validation
+ Added comprehensive dataset summary statistics (deaths, critical cases, pediatric cases, severity averages)
+ Added unique category/block/sub-block counting for data quality assessment
+ Output: transformed_dataset.csv with clean, standardized structure
